# sks (Submodules Kill Solidity)
Lets face it.. Foundry submodules are terrible.
This is a simple cli that acts as a basic package manager to avoid this
issue

## Installation
Clone the repo then run our install script
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Will-Smith11/sks.git
cd sks
sudo chmod +x sks_install
./sks_install
```
